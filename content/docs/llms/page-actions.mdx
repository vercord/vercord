# Page Actions

Two buttons on every documentation page: "Copy Markdown" and "Open" dropdown.

## Copy Markdown Button

Copies the page's raw content to clipboard.

1. Fetches content from `[page-url].mdx`
2. Caches the result for subsequent copies
3. Copies to clipboard using Clipboard API
4. Shows check icon when complete

## Open Dropdown

Opens the current page in external tools:

| Option              | Action                                     |
